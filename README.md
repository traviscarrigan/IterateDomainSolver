# IterateDomainSolver
The script reports the relative improvement for the maximum included angle for a set of specific solver settings over various iterations provided by the user.

## Usage
The script will load up *grid.pw* and run through all the iterations in *iterationList* for a given boundary control function and interior control function. This was originally intended to demonstrate that running the elliptic solver more iterations does not guarantee a higher quality grid.
